<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
Hello. My name is Kevin. I just finished a master's degree in physics at UChicago. In a previous life I worked in tech, at Genius, Twitter, and Apple. You can read more about my professional life on <%= link_to "Linked In", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinullmann", target: :_blank %> . As for the personal stuff, I love dogs, am trying to improve my chess game, and have been known to pilot a paraglider named Daisy <small><%= link_to "(poorlyâ€¦)", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTw143UWWOk", target: :_blank %></small>
